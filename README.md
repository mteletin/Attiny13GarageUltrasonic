Attiny13 Ultrasonic Sensor with RGB Led Strip distance indicator


Fuses for Attiny13
Low: 0x7A

I've used
1. an ULN2003 as the LED driver (Recycled from a 5V 4phase stepper driver which was useless for me).
2. Attiny13A (cheap ebay version).
3. DC-DC 5V to 12V calibrated
4. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor
5. Perfboard PCB
6. Wires, proper connectors & some soldering.

Will update soon with schematics and PCB.
