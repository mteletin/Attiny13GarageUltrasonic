---
1. an ULN2003 as the LED driver (Recycled from a 5V 4phase stepper driver which was useless for me).
2. Attiny13A (cheap ebay version).
3. DC-DC 5V to 12V calibrated
4. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor
5. Perfboard PCB
6. Wires, proper connectors & some soldering.


Will update soon with schematics and PCB.

I've used Atmel Studio 7.0 for the code (way smaller binary than Arduino and less fuss).
